# NLP-Textclassification-
NLP is used for sentiment analysis , topic and language detection. #import data #EDA #Data cleaning #import re (regular expression) #import string #Word frequency #Removing Stopwords #from nltk.corpus import stopwords #word frequency after removal of stopwords #from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import Countvectorizer #countvectorizer tells the frequency of words #TF-IDF Term frequency Document frequency #from sklearn.feature_extraction.import TfidVectorizer #TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Dense Frequency) is a technique which is used to find meaning of sentences consisting of words and cancels out the incapabilities of Bag of Words technique which is good for text classification or for helping machine read words in numbers. # N-gram :A set of co-occuring words within a given window and when computing n-grams typically move one word forward. #Bi-gram  - Two word sequence #Tri-gram - Three word sequence #Bi-gram and Tri-gram plot  #Wordcloud- it is  visual displays of text data â€“ simple text analysis.#from wordclud import WordCloud #Applying Navie Bayes for classification #Using TFIDF
